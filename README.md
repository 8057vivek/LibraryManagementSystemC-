📚 Simple Library Management System
📝 Introduction
During the summer break, I had the opportunity to participate in a training session focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. This training provided me with foundational knowledge in various data structures such as:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Queues
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees (BST)
AVL Trees
Stacks
Vectors
As part of this training, I worked on a project titled "Simple Library Management System" in C++, which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario.

📌 Project Overview
The Simple Library Management System project simulates basic library functionalities, enabling a librarian to:

Manage books 📚
Track issued books 📒
Perform search and sort operations 🔍
This project consolidates the understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

🚀 Project Features
➕ Add New Books
Functionality: The librarian can add new books with unique IDs, titles, authors, and status (available or issued).
Data Structures Used: Arrays or Linked Lists
🔍 Search for a Book
Functionality: Search for a book by its title or ID, and display its details, including status.
Algorithms Used: Binary Search (for sorted data) or Linear Search (for unsorted data)
📦 Issue a Book
Functionality: Change the book's status to "issued" and store the student's details.
Data Structures Used: Stack (LIFO) or Queue (FIFO)
📬 Return a Book
Functionality: Update the book's status to "available" and remove the student's details.
Process: Reverse the issuance operation.
📄 List All Books
Functionality: View a list of all books in the library.
Algorithms Used: Quick Sort or Merge Sort to display books sorted by ID or title.
🗑️ Delete a Book
Functionality: Remove a book from the system.
Data Structures Used: Linked List (to remove the respective node)
🛠️ Data Structures and Algorithms Used
This project was an excellent opportunity to apply a variety of data structures and algorithms:

Arrays and Linked Lists: For storing book records. Arrays offer fast access, while Linked Lists provide flexibility in insertion/deletion.
Search Algorithms: Binary Search for sorted collections and Linear Search for unsorted ones.
Stack and Queue: For managing the issue and return process of books.
Sorting Algorithms: Quick Sort and Merge Sort for organizing the book list.
🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project provided hands-on experience in implementing data structures and algorithms in a real-world application. Key learnings include:

Understanding Data Structures: Deepened knowledge of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, and how to select the appropriate structure for a task.
Algorithm Implementation: Enhanced understanding of search and sort algorithms and their appropriate use cases.
Problem-Solving and System Design: Improved problem-solving skills and insights into system design.
Software Development in C++: Gained proficiency in C++ and learned best practices in software development.
✅ Conclusion
The Simple Library Management System project was a significant part of my summer training on Data Structures and Algorithms. It allowed me to apply the concepts I learned meaningfully, providing a solid foundation for future projects involving more complex data structures and algorithms. This experience has not only strengthened my technical skills but also prepared me for tackling advanced challenges in software development.
