📚****Simple Library Management System****</br></br>
📝 **Introduction**</br>
During the summer break, I had the opportunity to participate in a training session focused on Data Structures and Algorithms.
This training provided me with foundational knowledge in various data structures such as:</br>

* Arrays</br>
* Linked Lists</br>
* Queues</br>
* Binary Trees</br>
* Binary Search Trees (BST)</br>
* AVL Trees</br>
* Stacks</br>
* Vectors</br>
As part of this training, I worked on a project titled "Simple Library Management System" in C++, which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario. </br></br>

📌 **Project Overview**</br>
The Simple Library Management System project simulates basic library functionalities, enabling a librarian to:</br>

* <i>Manage books</i> 📚</br>
* <i>Track issued books</i> 📒</br>
* <i>Perform search and sort operations</i> 🔍</br>
* <i>This project consolidates the understanding of various data structures and algorithms.</i></br></br>

🚀 **Project Features**</br></br>
➕ **Add New Books**</br></br>
**Functionality:** The librarian can add new books with unique IDs, titles, authors, and status (available or issued).</br>
**Data Structures Used:** Arrays or Linked Lists</br></br>
🔍 **Search for a Book**</br></br>
**Functionality:** Search for a book by its title or ID, and display its details, including status.</br>
**Algorithms Used:** Binary Search (for sorted data) or Linear Search (for unsorted data)</br></br>
📦 **Issue a Book**</br></br>
**Functionality:** Change the book's status to "issued" and store the student's details.</br>
**Data Structures Used:** Stack (LIFO) or Queue (FIFO)</br></br>
📬 **Return a Book**</br></br>
**Functionality:** Update the book's status to "available" and remove the student's details.</br>
**Process:** Reverse the issuance operation.</br></br>
📄 **List All Books**</br></br>
**Functionality:** View a list of all books in the library.</br>
**Algorithms Used:** Quick Sort or Merge Sort to display books sorted by ID or title.</br></br>
🗑️ **Delete a Book**</br></br>
**Functionality**: Remove a book from the system.</br>
**Data Structures Used:** Linked List (to remove the respective node)</br></br>
🛠️ **Data Structures and Algorithms Used**</br>
This project was an excellent opportunity to apply a variety of data structures and algorithms:</br>

**Arrays and Linked Lists:** For storing book records. Arrays offer fast access, while Linked Lists provide flexibility in insertion/deletion.</br>
**Search Algorithms:** Binary Search for sorted collections and Linear Search for unsorted ones.</br>
**Stack and Queue:** For managing the issue and return process of books.</br>
**Sorting Algorithms:** Quick Sort and Merge Sort for organizing the book list.</br></br>
🎯 **Learning Outcomes**</br>
This project provided hands-on experience in implementing data structures and algorithms in a real-world application. Key learnings include:</br>

**Understanding Data Structures:** Deepened knowledge of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, and how to select the appropriate structure for a task.</br>
**Algorithm Implementation:** Enhanced understanding of search and sort algorithms and their appropriate use cases.</br>
**Problem-Solving and System Design:** Improved problem-solving skills and insights into system design.</br>
**Software Development in C++:** Gained proficiency in C++ and learned best practices in software development.</br></br>
✅ **Conclusion**</br>
The Simple Library Management System project was a significant part of my summer training on Data Structures and Algorithms.</br>
It allowed me to apply the concepts I learned meaningfully, providing a solid foundation for future projects involving more complex data structures and algorithms.</br>
This experience has not only strengthened my technical skills but also prepared me for tackling advanced challenges in software development.</br>
